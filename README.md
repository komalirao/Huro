### How to use

The template is built with Sass and Gulp build system with these features:

- Handlebars HTML templates with Panini– Panini is a super simple flat file generator for use with Gulp. It compiles a series of HTML pages using a common layout. These pages can also include HTML partials, external Handlebars helpers, or external data as JSON.
- Sass compilation, prefixing with Autoprefixer, and JavaScript concatenation
- Built-in BrowserSync server - Will automatically reload your page when files are changed. It also live-injects CSS changes when you save a Sass file. This task runs continuously. Defaults to localhost.
- For production builds - CSS compression, JavaScript compression, Image compression and more..

- Node.js is used to run the build processes. https://nodejs.org/en/download/
